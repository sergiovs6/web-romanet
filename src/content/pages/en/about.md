## Project Overview

RomaNET is a European project funded under the CERV-2024-CHAR-LITI-SPEECH programme, dedicated to fighting hate speech and hate crimes against Roma communities through innovative AI technology and community engagement.

## Our Objectives

1. **Monitor Hate Speech**: Develop and implement AI-powered systems to identify and track hate speech against Roma communities across digital platforms
2. **Create Counter-Narratives**: Generate positive, accurate content that challenges stereotypes and promotes understanding
3. **Educate and Empower**: Provide training and resources to Roma communities and the general public
4. **Support Victims**: Connect individuals with legal and psychological support services
5. **Build Networks**: Foster collaboration between organizations across participating countries

## Countries & Context

RomaNET operates across three European countries, each bringing unique perspectives and challenges:
