## Innovation in Counter-Narratives

RomaNET pioneers the use of artificial intelligence to combat hate speech against Roma communities. Our AI-powered approach combines cutting-edge technology with human expertise to create positive, accurate counter-narratives.

## How Our AI Works

### 1. Detection & Monitoring
Our AI systems continuously monitor online platforms for hate speech targeting Roma communities:
- Natural language processing identifies harmful content
- Pattern recognition detects coordinated hate campaigns
- Real-time alerts notify our team of serious incidents
- Multi-language support covers all project countries

### 2. Analysis & Understanding
Once detected, hate speech is analyzed to understand:
- Common narratives and stereotypes being spread
- Platforms and networks where hate speech proliferates
- Trends and patterns over time
- Geographic distribution of incidents

### 3. Counter-Narrative Generation
Our AI assists in creating positive content that:
- Challenges stereotypes with facts
- Humanizes Roma communities through storytelling
- Provides accurate historical and cultural information
- Uses engaging formats (text, images, video scripts)

## The Innovation of Our Model

### What Makes Us Different

**Human-Centered AI**: Unlike fully automated systems, RomaNET places humans at the center:
- AI assists, humans decide
- Community voices guide content creation
- Cultural sensitivity is prioritized
- Accuracy is verified by experts

**Context-Aware**: Our AI understands:
- Cultural nuances across different countries
- Historical context of antigypsyism
- Language variations and dialects
- Platform-specific communication styles

**Ethical Framework**: We follow strict ethical guidelines:

5. **Reporting**: Regular reports track trends and patterns

### Privacy & Ethics
