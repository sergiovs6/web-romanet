## How to Report Hate Speech

Reporting hate speech helps protect communities and hold perpetrators accountable. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Document the Incident
- **Screenshot or Record**: Save evidence of the hate speech (screenshots, URLs, dates, times)
- **Context**: Note where it occurred (social media platform, website, physical location)
- **Witnesses**: If applicable, gather witness information
- **Your Safety First**: Do not engage with the perpetrator if it puts you at risk

### Step 2: Report to the Platform
Most social media platforms have reporting mechanisms:
- Facebook/Instagram: Use the "Report" function
- Twitter/X: Click on the three dots and select "Report"
- TikTok: Long-press the content and select "Report"
- YouTube: Click "Report" under the video

### Step 3: Report to Authorities
Depending on severity, you may want to report to police or relevant authorities.
