## A New Chapter in Fighting Discrimination

Today marks the official launch of RomaNET, a groundbreaking European initiative dedicated to combating hate speech and hate crimes targeting Roma communities. Funded by the European Union under the CERV-2024-CHAR-LITI-SPEECH programme, the project brings together partners from Spain, Italy, and Greece.

## Our Vision

RomaNET aims to create a safer digital environment for Roma communities by:
- Monitoring and documenting hate speech incidents
- Creating positive counter-narratives using AI technology
- Providing support and resources to victims
- Building a network of organizations committed to fighting discrimination

## Partners United

The project unites leading organizations:
- **Kamira** (Spain) - National Federation of Roma Women's Associations
- **Romni** (Italy) - Roma women's organization
- **Association of Greek Roma Mediators** (Greece)
- **Universidad de Jaén** (Spain) - Academic partner

## What's Next

Over the next 24 months, RomaNET will:
1. Develop AI-powered monitoring systems
2. Create training programs for communities
3. Generate counter-narratives that challenge stereotypes
4. Establish support networks across Europe
5. Share best practices and research findings

## Get Involved

We invite Roma communities, civil society organizations, researchers, and allies to join us in this important work. Together, we can make a difference.
